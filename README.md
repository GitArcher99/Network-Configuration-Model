An Ip address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, allowing communication with each other by routing data. The DNS translates readable domains into IP addresses, making it easier for users to access websites without memorizing number addresses. A server is a computer that provides services or resources, such as data or applications, to other devices on the network. A client is any device or software that requests these services from a server, relying on the server for access to resources. A VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet, allowing remote users to access a private network safely. It ensures that sensitive data is protected from cyber threats. A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic, blocking unauthorized access and protecting the network from malicious threats. LAN connect devices within a small connection areas like homes or small offices, allowing them to share resources and communicate easily. In contrast, WAN cover larger areas, connecting multiple LANs and enabling communication between remote locations or across the globe. Together, these concepts ensure secure, efficient communication and resource sharing within networks.

I created a network setup diagram based on Justin Altuve's home setup. The network setup includes a cable modem connected to a wireless router, which provides internet access to devices like a desktop PC, laptop, IP phone, printer, and a digital camera that syncs with the laptop. The router manages internet traffic, and the firewall helps protect the network. A firewall is used for network security, protecting the devices from unauthorized access. Each device being covered by a firewall is key to securing Justin's information.
